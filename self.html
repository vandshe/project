<p><b><i><strong>***Breaking News:AlphaGo has won the first two matches!***</strong></b>In this, the third in our series on the epic Go matches being played<br/> between AlphaGo (Google's Artificical Intelligence software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion), we look at the history of<br/> Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have led to this incredible moment in time.</i></p>

<p>For as long as humans built things, we've wrestled with the implications of what we've built. In many cases,these philosophical and<br/>ethical wrestlings have made for great drama&#8210;think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision<br/> come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we've made in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a<br/> "computer with a mind if its own" is "<s> going to take over the world </s>  not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.</p>
<h2>The Triumph Of Deep Blue</h2>
<p>Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. machines competition, because the idea of being overcomeby that which we've<br/>created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness. When IBM's Deep Blue faced off against Garry Kasparov<sup>1</sup>, the <br/>event resulted in more than <font color=#0000A0><ins>three billion impressions </ins></font> around the world, and when IBM's later creation Watson challenged the champions on<br/>Jeopardy, million of viewers were glued to the proceedings.</p>
<h2>DeepMind's AlphaGo</h2>
<p>Taking place right now, there is an event that, while not likely to scale the same media heights, may in fact have far greater implications<br/>when it comes to the future of"intelligent" machines. On March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a computing system know as AlphoGo (built by<br/>reserachers at DeepMind&#8210;a Google Artificial Intelligence lab) began <font color=#0000A0><ins> a five-game match</ins></font> against lee Se-dol,one of the very best players in<br/>the world at ancient game of Go.</p>
<p>Why is this so significant?</p>
<p>Here is how the DeepMind team explained it in their paper <font color=#0000A0><ins>Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and tree Search:</ins></font></p>
<p><i>The Game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games fr artificial intelligence due to its enormous search space<br/>and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.</i></p>
<p>Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to craete machines that can "think" on their own, because<br/>success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something  more than just skill, knowledge, and experience. It requires intuition.<br/>Feel. Style. Characteristics we associate with humans, not with machines.</p>
